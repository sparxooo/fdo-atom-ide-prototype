# An FDO/Atom IDE prototype

I created this whilst playing with the P3 / FDO / Atom protocols used by AOL back in the day. It may or may not work now, but thought I'd put the source out there than it go stale on my hard drives, maybe someone will find it useful.

## Why?

I wish I knew. I had AOL dial-up as my first internet connection, and had to use the AOL software. I tried every which way to get round NOT using it, including installing RedHat Linux 9 on my computer, but then found even more problems (WinModems, compatibility... breaking the computer) :P

Some 20 years on, I would kinda like to revisit those days. Thanks to the P3OL project, you can! https://twitter.com/project_p3ol

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to Deceptio (www.deceptio.org), and the authors of PengAOL / Penggy - including, but possibly not limited to:

- Jean-Charles Salzeber \<chupa\>
- sam \<jolan\>
- Keith Reuters \<kreuters\>
- Sebastian Schmidt \<yath\>

For without their work, I would be no further along in this journey.

Also the author of "theaolprotocol.txt/.wri", a useful short writeup of the basics of the AOL P3 protocol.

And not forgetting the contributors/authors/owners of aol-files.com and the archives of those sites
